# Final Year Project ‚Äì YOLOv9 & LLM Integrated Diagnostic System

This is my Final Year Project that integrates the official YOLOv9 repository [YOLOv9](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9) with a custom-trained Fracture detection model for X-ray image diagnosis. The YOLOv9 model was trained from scratch on a medical imaging dataset [GRAZPEDWRI-DX] to accurately detect specific anomalies. The project also includes a Flask-based web interface for image uploads, real-time predictions, and diagnostic report generation using Large Language Model (LLM).




## üìÅ Project Structure

- `app/` ‚Äì Flask application files
- `models/yolov9/` ‚Äì YOLOv9 official repo (as a Git submodule)
- `static/` ‚Äì CSS, JS, and image files
- `templates/` ‚Äì HTML templates for the app

## üöÄ How to Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IslamNabi/Wrist-Abnormality-Detection-System-Using-Yolov9-and-LLMs.git
